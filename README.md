### Brief Biography of William Graif

I am finishing my at the University of Chicago. I am studying data science and public policy. I have been living in the same house near New York City since I was *nine months* old. I have also been both playing and teaching chess for a very long time. Here is me at K-1 Nationals:

I was once featured on the MLB website thanks to my famous friend!

I like to travel. Here is a list of some of the places that I have been outside of the US:

* France
    + Paris
    + Versailles
* Canada
    + Toronto
    + British Columbia
    + Montreal
* Turkey
* Greece
    + Athens
    + Halkidiki
* Vietnam

This was done by forking the repository online, and then creating a new project in R that was linked to my new GitHub repository. Everything is done under a local folder on my computer entitled "CFSS." I then committed, pushing and pulling in order to submit. My GitHub username and CNET ID is wgraif. I very much look forward to learning in this class!

Thank you,
William
